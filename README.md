# Swords-of-Chaos
# Python Redoux of Swords of Chaos for MajorBBS/Worldgroup

# This is the beginning of the recreation of one of the most well known MUDs in the history of the internet.
# Mark Peterson's original Swords of Chaos.

# Just created the GitHub. We will be using the python MUD framework Evennia, and the rewrite will use python mostly.
# Anyone interested in contributing is welcome.
# This is a complete rewrite, as the original SoC's source code is not available.
